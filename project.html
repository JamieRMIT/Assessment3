                <h3 class="text-center">Topic</h4>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">This project is to help people who need to display information on their vehicles and to do it quickly and easily by using a colour E-Ink display partnered with an Arduino Nano. The displays will have two separate ways of being displayed. For cars, they can use window mounts for both the front and rear windscreens, these can also be used separately. For example, being mounted only on the rear windscreen or number plate mounts so that the displays can be mounted next to the number plates on the front or back of the vehicles. For trucks and other vehicles, they can be mounted on the back of trailers and the front of the cabin.</p>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">With the help of an iOS and Android application the user of these screens will be able to choose what is being displayed on the screens at any time. For example, the Australian learners or provisional plates can be displayed to help other drivers understand that the car is being driving by one of those drivers. These screens when used on their own or can also show novity signs like stick figure families or baby on board signs. </p>
                <h3 class="text-center">Motivation</h4>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">Our motivation behind doing this E-Ink display project is to make it easier for drivers to display information to other drivers. At present we have a vast range of information being displayed on cars that could be integrated into a single solution to help make it easier for people to get the right information displayed on their vehicles.</p>
                <h3 class="text-center">Landscape</h4>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">Right now, vehicle owners need to use decals, stick on plates like Ls or Ps, metal plates to show danger signs. However, there is nothing out in the wilderness that gives everything in one spot and help to reduce the waste when these signs or decals are no longer wanted.</p>

 <p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">my team and I will test our product in multiple different ways so that will give us the best outcome.
 The first start of our testing will be testing every small component to ensuring that it is reactive and running correctly.
 This will consist of making sure that all the buttons on the device are responsive when pressed and or pressed multiple times and that all of the LEDs and screen is functioning to their full capability, confirming that pairing devices with it works correctly on all type of different systems such as Android, iPhone, google pixel. So that my team and I can get a confirmation on the blue tooth pairing to its full extent. As well as testing how far the blue tooth pairing can be used to ensure it will work in all types of cars and long vehicles. From here my team and I will test if this device can 
allow us to pair multiple devices at once and which device takes priority and confirm that it will still work after more than one device is paired. Testing how the device interface works on the app and how responsive it will be to the device, making sure that it changes in adequate time, looking at how responsive the image on the back is and in the time frame it changes. We can't forget the simple things to see how well the app handles after long periods of being opened and closed on multiple occasions. After the testing of the internal network of the devices has been done, From here we will would move on to the physical test of the device, How durable the device is under pressure from sunlight. This would enable us to test this by placing it in the sun for an extensive period of time and trying all the functions thoroughly after that. Dropping the device from different levels of heigh and on other surfaces to test how well the device's durability is after that. Can the device stay stuck on a window for extensive times with no issues, or do we need replaceable suction cups that can be rotated in and out to allow the device to stay up for an extensive duration of time, After we confirm that all of the above works effectively and efficiently, From here we will take it into a live test and see how it works in a real-life scenario, from bumpy roads to smooth roads.
 If all of our testing goes well, and we can not find any faults inside or outside of the device, and after this we will assess and confirm if pass all of our expected outcomes, the device will be ready for public use. Examples below</p>

                <!-- Risks -->

<h3 class="text-center text-black">New Screen Technology Libraries and Samples </h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk: </h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The E-Ink colour style displays are a relatively new piece of hardware and not widely used. There are not many options with interfacing with these types of displays from a software point of view, particularly with available libraries. </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">This can make development difficult, time consuming or impossible depending on the available libraries or provided software. There are a few hardware options for these colour type displays so if there is an issue with one brand or manufacturer then development can move to another. </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Low - Medium</h4>
 
<h3 class="text-center text-black">E-Ink Screen Day/ Night Visibility</h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">With untested technology there could be a chance that the E-Ink displays don’t show well in direct sunlight. It is a requirement for the displays to be visible in direct sunlight and night-time. There is no requirement for it to be illuminated at night other than from an external source (e.g. headlights of another car). </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6"> If direct sunlight causes the display to not be legible or damage the display in some way, or not reflective or visible enough at night, then an E-Ink display will not be a feasible solution.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Medium</h4>
 
<h3 class="text-center text-black">Display Failure</h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The Risk of the displays having malfunctioning issues, for example the risk of LED’s or the display flickering and causing distractions, overheating, displaying incorrect colour on the display, glare, etc.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">This could cause distractions to the drivers behind. Now showing the correct image could lead to punishment of not correctly showing your designated sign.
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Low</h4>
 
<h3 class="text-center text-black">App Development Time</h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The risk of the app development time to take too long to meet product goals with the requirement for an Android and IOS app using Xamarin.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">If development time is restricted and only one platform is developed, initial release would only be for one device, e.g. Android only. This will miss a large market share of users causing the product to not be adopted.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Low</h4>

<h3 class="text-center text-black">App Function Requirements</h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The app does not function across all mobile platform and devices/ does not have multi-device support.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">Customers using one particular device, e.g. an Apple IOS device, uses different functions for Bluetooth connectivity, causing difficulty developing resulting in an increase in development time.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Medium</h4>
 
<h3 class="text-center text-black">App Functioning</h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4>  
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The apps ability to function while under stress, reactive time to changing screen and commands. Turning on and off. No user friendly with the interface.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">  Customer disinterest in the device if the app doesn’t work. Issues with how well the user can navigate through different sectors can cause stress on the consumer. </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Low</h4>
 
<h3 class="text-center text-black">Bluetooth </h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The connectivity of the device to a mobile phone if the device has troubles with not connecting to multiple devices at once, staying connected for a long period of time or the distance from the phone to the E-Ink Display. </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">if the device fails to connect to multiple mobiles this can cause frustration for the customer. It would be less ideal to family's who have kids who would both need to use it. Making it less desirable for larger parties.</p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Medium</h4>
 
<h3 class="text-center text-black">Device Stability</h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The Device is unable to withstand the outside elements causing it to work as no longer designed to. </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">The Device overheats causing it to no longer work or melts in direct sunlight in a car, so that it no longer works at a regulated level. This can leave damage to the back of the car from overheating, as well as the driver not having the correct plates. </p> 
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Very - Low</h4>
 
<h3 class="text-center text-black">Circuit Board</h3>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Risk:</h4> 
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">Circuit boards can have a lot of ongoing issues, overheating and the soldering not holding up well over time and poorly manufactured components. </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Impact: <h4>
<p class="text-black text-center mlr3 mb6">  Circuit Board issues would mean the whole device would need to be pulled apart and remade, the impact of this is cost as well as a bad look on using a circuit board that cannot with stand pressure. 
This is also an inconvenience for the customer. Manufacturing will also need to change and cause additional costs. </p>
<h4 class="text-center text-black">Probability: Low</h4>
