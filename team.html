                <h3 class="text-center">Christopher</h3>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">My career plans have less changed in ways I would not have imagined since the beginning of the prerequisite introductory courses due to a range of factors. Prior to the commencement the Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming, I didn’t envisage programming being as difficult to comprehend as it is. This does not mean that I have or will give up on it but my inability to do so means that at this time it is in my best interest to pursue a different career, instead I will begin studying for the Bachelor of Arts majoring in Japanese, which I am already fluent in with the hope to move on to a translation course upon its completion. I hope that while I am studying for the Bachelor of Arts (Japanese) I will be able to study programming at my own pace and perhaps try again in a few years’ time as a second degree.</p>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">I still have a vested interest in technology and the Introduction to IT course in particular has definitely whetted my appetite. I have had an absolute blast working with my teammates and will cherish the time with them for years to come. While working on the project, I was taken aback by how enamoured some members were with my project idea, it being chosen for our group project, that one member when as far as to build a prototype of it. If we were able to go into business with this idea and actually make some real money with it, it would make this whole endeavour worthwhile.</p>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">In conclusion, thanks to this course, even though I have chosen to drop it and study for a completely different degree next semester, I now have a range of options open to me. I can go into business with my group members with the E-Ink Car Display while pursuing a career in translation.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">John</h3>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">Managing and implementing this project has brought out my desire to make my own IoT devices and pursue staring my own business. A great man once said “Don’t let your dreams be dreams! Just! Do! It!” This project is a perfect example of that, we took an idea and made it happen. I believe this can be done for anything and have a passion to make that happen for as many ideas that I have or can find. This changes my career path slightly from Assignment 1 and 2.</p>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">Completing the security modules and tutorials of the course has also sparked and old flame from my younger years reading Whitehat book and dabbling in penetration testing and vulnerability testing. This has moved me towards exploring an IT Security type role as a career and as a result I plan on exploring further education in this and as a viable career path for me post-graduation. Again, this changes my career path from Assignment 1 and 2, being more in-line with most members of this group looking to explore Security.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Oliver</h3>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">Upon working my way through Introduction to Information Technology I have already learnt so much in such a short period of time. My indicial career path decision is still unknown to a what area of the IT industry I want to pursue. However, I still do have an interest in the Cyber Security sector and after completing the AI and Robotics unit of the subject it has sparked an interest in this field as well. I did initially start this semester studying both Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming, although I did have to drop Programming as I was not able to keep up with the workload while working fulltime. I am retaking Introduction to Programming at the end of this subject and hope to better immerse myself into the course and gain basic programming skills.</p>
                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">My current plan is to continue working my way through the degree and hopefully gain an internship in my final stages of study. Also, towards the end of my studies I intend to stop working fulltime and concentrate on my new career path. Hopefully gaining an internship with a reputable organisation will help kickstart my career in whatever sector I choose in the IT world.</p>

                <p class="text-snow text-center mlr3 mb6">Whilest I have undertaken the Intro to IT unit I have managed to complete all the modules as well as complete assessmets with ease. I have meet some amazing people along the way who I was lucky enough to work with on assessments 2, 3 & 5. I plan to continue my studies at RMIT and finish my degree by taking it one unit at a time whilest also working full time in the IT industy with ADITS Townsville.</p>
